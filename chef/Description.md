Attributes represent information about your node. 
In addition to the information that can be automatically generated by ohai,
 you can set attributes in Chef recipes or in separate attribute files.

<cookbook>
 └── attributes
   └── default.rb


# There is a priority

	  Defined in a recipe
Lowest--> Defined in a an trribute file




# Why

You might wonder why there is a need for this priority mechanism with Chef attributes. 
It’s because like in most other programming languages, a Chef recipe can reference other
 Chef recipe files using an “include” statement: include_recipe. So when your Chef code
 is processed during a Chef run, it could possibly include a chain of references to 
multiple recipe files that might even be in other cookbooks, as shown in Figure 8-4.
 Because you can use include_recipe, Chef code might contain conflicting attribute 
assignments, and there needs to be some guidelines for how these conflicts are resolved.
